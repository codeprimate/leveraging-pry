      %h1 Leveraging Pry
      %p
        Pry is an awesome tool that replaces IRB and can help you better understand your code.
      %ul
        %li It is like IRB, but with more features.
        %li Your object graph acts like a filesystem! 
        %li 
          Can replace 
          %code ruby-debugger
          when used in conjunction with extensions like
          %code pry-nav
          and
          %code pry-stack_explorer
        %li Lots of extensions for greater awesomesauce.
      %p Pry doesn't require Rails, but tutorial will discuss Pry in the context of a Rails application.
